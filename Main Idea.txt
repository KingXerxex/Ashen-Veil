Plot Points
I want to make a short rpg maker game as a prolouge to BSA

Since veil is this mysterious entity, what if she has been alive for centuries, staying alive via magical means at first, then replacing it with scientific (when lolita's dad was able to make a replacement)

and the rpg maker game would visit that point centuries ago when the Ashen Veil was once formed from a band of adventurers taking down a legion of evil

Long ago, in a kingdom deep in the heart of Europa a band of adventurers brought together by a common sense of justice assemble. Arteaus Vanus, Carina Easterfell, Belladonna Isenolde, and Hrolti Hammerfist.
This is the story of how the mage Belladonna Isenolde, alongside her companions, faced the encroaching darkness of Malakor. It is the tale of their sacrifice, and how she alone was forced to carry the weight of their combined souls to become the eternal guardian known as the Veil.
The four are the sole survivors of a brutal massacre in the town of Silvercreek, where the Whispering Blight was first unleashed. Arteaus, a knight whose garrison was wiped out; Carina, a hunter whose village was razed; Belladonna, an acolyte whose monastery was desecrated; and Hrolti, a smith whose family was lost, are bound by their shared tragedy and unique immunity or resistance to the Blight's immediate effects.
A malevolent entity known as Malakor has unleashed the 'Whispering Blight' upon the kingdom. This magical corruption infects the weak-willed, turning them into violent husks of their former selves and causing societal collapse.
Our band of travellers must band together to purge the Whispering Blight from the Kingdom of Aeridor and destroy its source before the corruption spreads beyond the borders and becomes an unstoppable global pandemic.
Early in their quest, the party performs a 'Pact of Unity,' a dangerous ritual meant to bind their fates and amplify their strengths against the Blight. They are warned that should any member fall, their spiritual essence will be absorbed by the survivors. At the climax, this pact tragically fulfills its purpose, funneling the essences of Arteaus, Carina, and Hrolti into Belladonna.
The immense power gained from the 'Pact of Unity' fundamentally alters Belladonna's mortality, anchoring her to the physical world but severing her from the natural cycle of life and death. To manage this eternal burden and honor her fallen friends, she establishes the Ashen Veil, an order dedicated to preventing such calamities from occurring again.
Post-story, Belladonna sustains her unnaturally long life by drawing sustenance from 'Echoes of Ruin'â€”the residual psychic and magical energies left in places of great suffering or momentous events, a constant and grim reminder of the world she has sworn to protect.

- Setting: The Kingdom of Aeridor, on the continent of Elyria.
- Antagonist: Malakor the Void-Touched.
- Faction: The Ashen Veil.

- Arteaus Vanus: The stalwart Paladin, wielder of holy light and the party's defender.
- Carina Easterfell: The keen-eyed Ranger, master of the bow and expert tracker.
- Belladonna Isenolde: The resourceful Rogue/Mage, specializing in arcane debuffs and alchemy.
- Hrolti Hammerfist: The indomitable Dwarven Berserker, a force of raw, untamed power.

Post Main story would follow Belladonna as she becomes the Veil and forms the Ashen Veil, keeping herself alive for centuries off of latent magical energies.


Prologue: The Ashen Veil
In the Kingdom of Aeridor, a shadow falls. A magical plague, the 'Whispering Blight,' sweeps across the land, turning neighbor against neighbor and plunging civilization into a violent madness. At the heart of this corruption is the malevolent entity known as Malakor, whose influence eats away at the very soul of the kingdom.

From the ashes of the first outbreak in the ravaged town of Silvercreek, four survivors emerge, bound by a shared, grim fate. They are Arteaus Vanus, the last knight of his garrison; Carina Easterfell, a hunter whose village was erased; Hrolti Hammerfist, a dwarven smith who lost his kin; and Belladonna Isenolde, an acolyte from a desecrated monastery. United by their tragic losses and a strange resistance to the Blight, they are the realm's only hope.

To stand against Malakor's overwhelming power, the four companions undertake a dangerous ritual known as the 'Pact of Unity,' a bond that merges their life forces. The pact grants them the strength to fight the Blight, but carries a terrible price: should any member fall in battle, their essence, their very soul, will be absorbed by the survivors.

This is not a tale of how four heroes saved the world. This is the chronicle of their sacrifice. Witness the journey that forges a legend through loss, and see how three champions must fall so that one may endure. This is the story of how Belladonna Isenolde carried the weight of her friends' souls to become the immortal guardian known only as the Veil, the founder of the Ashen Veil, and the silent protector for the centuries of darkness to come.

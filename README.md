# Ashen Veil
Prologue: The Ashen Veil
In the Kingdom of Aeridor, a shadow falls. A magical plague, the 'Whispering Blight,' sweeps across the land, turning neighbor against neighbor and plunging civilization into a violent madness. At the heart of this corruption is the malevolent entity known as Malakor, whose influence eats away at the very soul of the kingdom.

From the ashes of the first outbreak in the ravaged town of Silvercreek, four survivors emerge, bound by a shared, grim fate. They are Arteaus Vanus, the last knight of his garrison; Carina Easterfell, a hunter whose village was erased; Hrolti Hammerfist, a dwarven smith who lost his kin; and Belladonna Isenolde, an acolyte from a desecrated monastery. United by their tragic losses and a strange resistance to the Blight, they are the realm's only hope.

To stand against Malakor's overwhelming power, the four companions undertake a dangerous ritual known as the 'Pact of Unity,' a bond that merges their life forces. The pact grants them the strength to fight the Blight, but carries a terrible price: should any member fall in battle, their essence, their very soul, will be absorbed by the survivors.

This is not a tale of how four heroes saved the world. This is the chronicle of their sacrifice. Witness the journey that forges a legend through loss, and see how three champions must fall so that one may endure. This is the story of how Belladonna Isenolde carried the weight of her friends' souls to become the immortal guardian known only as the Veil, the founder of the Ashen Veil, and the silent protector for the centuries of darkness to come.
